# Python Data Analysis Project

Hii I'm Ravneet Singh, I'm getting into the data analytics world and recently I started learning Python, although I still need to learn a lot but still I tried to make a quick project as well. 
I have followed a YouTube tutorial for this project and also the data provided here is also from the tutorial. You can search on YouTube 'Rishab Mishra Python Project' and the video will pop-up. I hope in future I'm able to work directly on a project without following anykind of tutorial.
Still need to learn a lot and go a long way on my data analysis journey ðŸ’¯


You can download the csv file for the raw data and Jupyter notebook for the code to see the every kind of analysis I did.
